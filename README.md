# ml-portal
 - The unified ML UI interface to host a series of ML modeling in DC.

As a first step to provide Machine Learning capability through ml-portal, we explored Streamlit as a Machine Learning & data science tool.

## App to derive geo-locations from EC Service Logs
This app is designed to provide ability to users to upload EC Service Logs to get the geo-locations of the EC agents. The users can upload the service-logs either through an API endpoint (FastAPI) or through a UI (Streamlit).
Here is the process flow to derive geo-locations from EC Service Logs: ![Geo-Locations_Process_Flow](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20440873/131028463-8b78ce59-6dd8-4fbe-939f-f28b568dd896.png)
